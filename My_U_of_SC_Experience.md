# Introduction

  My beyond the classroom experience was when I went to South Africa for my veterinary training. I got selected to work hands on with cheetahs, caracals, servals, lions, and meerkats. I learned so much about my field and intended specialty. My within the classroom experience was my U101 class and the self reflection it had caused. It had such a positive impact on my foundation at our university. 

## Within-the-Classroom (WTC): 

  My U101 class was stellar. I connected incredibly with my professor. Our bond has allowed me to ask for personal advice and even letters of recommendation. I felt so comfortable with my peers in sharing the high highs and low lows of a first semester in college. I remember in my own U101 course, my teacher asked what each of us are passionate about. The room fell silent and everyone stared blankly back at our teacher. No one felt passionate... about anything. Every student was completely surprised by the question, and could not answer. This moment has carried with me for a long time; I was surprised that no one could list anything they were passionate about. No goals, no spark, nothing. This is not to say that my classmates are any less passionate, or less motivated, by any means. It was just such a provoking question, that it left us all, quite literally, speechless. I went home after class and found myself unable to shake this curious feeling. Why am I in college? Why am 
 
**I a Biology Major? What do I stand for? Who do I want to be? Who am I?** 
  These questions overwhelmed me to the point of insomnia, to the point where I had to sit at my desk, pull out a piece of notebook paper, and begin to write. I wrote about my hobbies as a child, about my clubs, my sports, my school. I wrote about my friends and family. I wrote about my favorite things. All of this led me to the same, recurring theme: Helping others. Everything I enjoyed leading up to that moment revolved around me supporting those around me, whether it be my pet lizard, my cousins, my dogs, my aunts, my uncles... everyone I loved, everything I loved, was in the world around me. That is when I felt the true passion of altruism, acts of selflessness. That is when I found my passion. I love animals, people, travel, learning, and creating. I find peace in knowing I am able to positively impact someone's day. I pride myself on my self reflection and accountability. When I mess up, I take full responsibility and learn from my mistakes. "The past can hurt, but the way I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it."- The Lion King

## Beyond-the-Classroom (BTC):
  I wanted to travel so badly and South Africa is such a beautiful country; I loved their unique culture and wildlife. There is no other program like it, and no other country like South Africa. I hoped to gain knowledge from this program that I know I cannot receive anywhere else. That is exactly what happened. It was so meaningful to me to see the direct impact Veterinarians have on wildlife. It has completely led me on the journey Iâ€™ve now set for myself in zoo medicine. My favorite moment was taking blood from a semi-wild horse's jugular vein. I learned about enrichments, ethograms, and loads of medical terminology that support my career for the rest of my life.

## Connection:
  My experience in the classroom caused me to feel a stronger passion for my future endeavors. This directly led to my travels and education in South Africa. They influence each other through hard work, drive, and passion. Both involved such pivotal self goals and motivation for me. A lot of what I had learned about teamwork and goal setting came from my U101 class and led to such a smooth transition when I came to Africa and met my vet team. I was lucky to have such a broad cultural education as well, especially through my anthropology minor. It led me to greatly appreciate all the amazing people I met from all over the world. My professor, Dr. Stawkowski, was a great person in pushing me to do best in my anthropological studies and life. I am so grateful for being able to have both experiences and connecting the two throughout my life. Both have carried such deep meaning and pride for me.
